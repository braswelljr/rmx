## force

Ignore nonexistent files and arguments, and never prompt.

### Description

The `-f`/`--force` flag makes `rmx` ignore files that do not exist (exiting successfully instead of reporting an error) and suppresses every confirmation prompt, including the write-protected-file prompt. It is what turns `rmx` into an unattended, script-safe delete. `-f` only affects prompting and missing-file errors; it does not enable directory removal — combine it with `-r` for that.

### Permissions

`-f` skips the write-protected-file prompt, so read-only files are removed without asking. Deletion is still governed by the parent directory's permissions, not the file's own mode: if you lack write+execute on the containing directory the removal fails with 'Permission denied' even under `-f`.

### Use cases

- Unattended cleanup in CI pipelines and shell scripts where prompts would hang.
- Deleting paths that may or may not exist without treating absence as an error.
- Removing read-only or write-protected files without per-file confirmation.

### Flags

```text
  -f, --force   ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt
```

### Examples

Remove a file, succeeding silently if it is already gone:

```bash
rmx -f maybe-missing.log
```

```powershell
rmx -f maybe-missing.log
```

Recursively delete a build directory with no prompts:

```bash
rmx -rf build/
```

```powershell
rmx -rf build
```
