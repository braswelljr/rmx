recursive
---------

Remove directories and their contents recursively (-r, -R).

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~


By default rmx refuses to remove directories. -r (or its alias -R) removes each directory and everything beneath it, walking the tree post-order so children are removed before their parents. It composes with the other flags: -ri prompts per entry, -rv reports each removal, -rf deletes without prompting.

PERMISSIONS. Recursive removal needs read+execute permission to list and descend into each directory, and write permission on a directory to unlink the entries inside it. A directory you cannot write to fails with 'Permission denied' and its contents are left in place. The --preserve-root failsafe additionally refuses to recurse on '/'.

USE CASES.
  - Deleting a directory and all of its contents in one command.
  - Clearing build/output trees (build/, dist/, node_modules/).
  - Combining with -i/-I for confirmation or -v to audit a large delete.
