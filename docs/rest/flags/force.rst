.. _force:

force
-----

Ignore nonexistent files and arguments, and never prompt.

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~


The -f/--force flag makes rmx ignore files that do not exist (exiting successfully instead of reporting an error) and suppresses every confirmation prompt, including the write-protected-file prompt. It is what turns rmx into an unattended, script-safe delete. -f only affects prompting and missing-file errors; it does not enable directory removal — combine it with -r for that.

PERMISSIONS. -f skips the write-protected-file prompt, so read-only files are removed without asking. Deletion is still governed by the parent directory's permissions, not the file's own mode: if you lack write+execute on the containing directory the removal fails with 'Permission denied' even under -f.

USE CASES.
  - Unattended cleanup in CI pipelines and shell scripts where prompts would hang.
  - Deleting paths that may or may not exist without treating absence as an error.
  - Removing read-only or write-protected files without per-file confirmation.
